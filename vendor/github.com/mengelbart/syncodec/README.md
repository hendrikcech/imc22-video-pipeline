# Synthetic Codecs

This repository contains an implementation of synthetic video traffic models for RTP congestion control evaluations.
At the moment there is only a simple encoder which emits perfect frames at perfect timing and a statistical encoder model, that implements the model described in [section 5 of RFC 8593](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8593.html#section-5).
